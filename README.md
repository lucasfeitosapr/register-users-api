# Register Users API

> A simple api to register users.


## What you will need:

- npm with sudo (global)
- nodejs
- make
- docker-compose
- Linux (not only linux, but we recomend it.)

### Clone

- Clone this repo to your local machine using `https://github.com/lucasfeitosapr/register-users-api.git`

### Setup

- After you installed all prerequisites, go inside the root (the place where the MakeFile is) and just run:

```shell
$ sudo make run
```
ps: this makefile script adds things to your etc/hosts file. That's why it needs sudo. Don't worry about it tho :)
